# Kalman_Filter_Pairs_Trading_Strategy
Statistical arbitrage represents a set of strategy types that capitalize on pricing discrepancies in related securities using statistical methods. The paper emphasizes the challenges faced by statistical arbitrage strategies, particularly on calculating the spread for a pair of assets and optimizing trading decisions. It presents a comprehensive framework that includes detecting similar assets through clustering, testing for cointegration, estimating the relationship between asset pairs using the Kalman filter, creating trading signals based on the spread, optimizing signal parameters, and backtesting the strategy to evaluate performance.
